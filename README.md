Overview of the repository
The build models for following three hypothesis group:
1. Tree Size
2. Understorey/Browsing
3. Coarse Woody Deris
Under each hypothesis family, the folder contains two sub-folders:
1. Model development (This folder contians all thorogh details about how we build and select our best models)
2. Final model (This folder contains the final models for each hypotheis family, and some visualisations before or after the modelling)


The hypothesis family for Tree Hollows is not able to be modeled due to lack of quantified records.

The Reference folder contains all the raw materials transferred from our client.

The Extra folder contains data pipeline as a tool for our client to resolve data extraction work from a series of data.
